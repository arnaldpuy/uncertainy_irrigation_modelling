# Uncertainty in global irrigation water use persists after 50 years of research

[Arnald Puy](https://www.arnaldpuy.com/), Carmen Aguil√≥, Seth N. Linga, Naomi Clarke, Nanxin Wei

This study compiles the estimations of irrigation water withdrawals produced between
1970 and 2024 and analyzes the spread of the uncertainty to see if it has increased
or decreased over time.

## Abstract

*In process.*

## Replication

We provide all the functions needed to replicate our workflow in the ``functions'' folder.

### Data

#### Generated data

The ''data'' folder contains the data and files produced in this study. The file named
''current'' compiles studies whose water estimates are either historical or current.
The file named ```projected'' includes studies with water-related variables projected 
into the future.

* `references_current.xlsx`   
* `references_projected.xlsx`   

#### Secondary data

Since we also used secondary data, we refer the interested reader to the following
links and repositories:

* [ISI-MIP](https://www.isimip.org/)
* [Khan et al 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02086-2)

### Code

We offer the code in `.R`, `.pdf` and `.Rmd`. Our entire workflow can be run and the 
results replicated from either of these files. The user must run the code from the 
same folder where the files in the primary data section are stored for a successful 
compilation.
