# Uncertainty grows as irrigation modelling advances

[Arnald Puy](https://www.arnaldpuy.com/), Nanxin Wei, Carmen Aguil√≥, Seth N. Linga

This study compiles the estimations of irrigation water withdrawals done between
1970 and 2024 and analyzes the spread of the uncertainty.

## Abstract

*In process.*

## Replication

We provide all the functions needed to replicate our workflow in the ``functions'' folder.

### Data

This repository contains the data and files produced in this study.

### Code

We offer the code in `.R`, `.pdf` and `.Rmd`. Our entire workflow can be run and the 
results replicated from either of these files. The user must run the code from the 
same folder where the files in the primary data section are stored for a successful 
compilation.
